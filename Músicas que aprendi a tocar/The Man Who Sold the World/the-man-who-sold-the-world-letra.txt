Nirvana - The Man Who Sold The World

[Intro] G#  C#m  E  C#m

[Solo 1]


[Primeira Parte]

                     G#
We passed upon the stairs
                         C#m
we spoke Of was and when
                    G#
Although I wasn't there
                         E
He said I was his friend
                        B   
Which came as some surprise 
                 G#
I spoke into his eyes
                     C#m
I thought you died alone
A long long time ago

[Refrão]


B             E
  Oh no, not me
    C              E
We never lost control
        B       E
You're face to face
          C                G#
With the man who sold the world

[Solo 1] G#  C#m  E  C#m


[Primeira Parte]

                         G#
I laughed and shook his hand
                          C#m
And made my way back home
                          G#
I searched from form and land
                             E
for years and years I roamed
                       B   
I gazed the gazeless stare 
                     G#
At all the millions hills
                   C#m
I must have died alone

A long long time ago

[Refrão]


B              E
  Who knows, not me
    C              E
We never lost control
        B         E
You're face to face
          C
With the man who sold the world
